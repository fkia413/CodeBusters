                    <p>Our  standard cinema screen is a fundamental component of the movie-watching experience. It's typically a large, flat surface on which movies are projected for the audience to view. Here are some key features and aspects of a standard cinema screen:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Size:</h4> 
                            The standard screen is large, covering a significant portion of the front wall in the auditorium. The size of the screen is designed to provide an immersive viewing experience.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Aspect Ratio:</h4>
                            The aspect ratio of a cinema screen is widescreen, with the most common aspect ratios being 16:9 or 2.39:1 (Cinemascope). These ratios are chosen to accommodate a wide range of movies and ensure that they fill the screen properly without distortion.<br>
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Projection Technology:</h4>
                            We use high-quality projection technology to display movies. Digital projection systems have largely replaced traditional film projectors, providing sharp and vibrant images.<br>
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Acoustic Properties:</h4>
                            In addition to the visual experience, our screens are designed to enhance the audio experience. The screen often includes perforations that allow sound to pass through, ensuring that the audience can hear the movie's soundtrack clearly. Behind the screen, there are often specialized speakers to create a surround sound effect.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Screen Material:</h4>
                            The screen itself is made of specialized materials designed to reflect and transmit light evenly, ensuring that the movie is displayed with high contrast and clarity.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Seating Arrangement:</h4>
                            The seating in a cinema is carefully arranged to optimize the viewing experience from every seat in the auditorium. The screen is typically positioned at the front of the room, and seats are arranged in tiers to provide clear sightlines.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Screen Curtains:</h4>
                            We use motorized curtains to cover the screen before the movie starts and reveal it when the movie begins. This adds an element of anticipation and spectacle to the experience.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <h4>3D and IMAX Screens:</h4>
                            We also offer speciality screens, such as 3D screens for viewing 3D movies and IMAX screens for a more immersive and larger-than-life experience.

                        <li>
                            <h4>Screen Maintenance:</h4>
